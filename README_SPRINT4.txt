A couple of notes about this sprint:

1) For the cash register, the retail price and wholesale totals
are based on the current orders that have been made in the emporium.
Profit is simply the total resale price - total wholesale cost.
2) Loading a file will completely overrite any existing content currently
in the program. For example, if some customers, servings, and orders
have been made and then a completely different set of files is loaded,
the contents of the program will now be from the files.
3) The xmi files may have some difficulty loading so screenshots of blue diagrams
have been attached. These are just diagrams with extra information.
The state machine diagram can be seen from the statemachine.png image.
4) The state machine implemented in the code is in the order.cpp file.
5) the txt files in the txt folder ARE NOT THE FILES BEING USED IN
THE PROGRAM. the txt files being used are already placed outside,
they just need to be loaded.
